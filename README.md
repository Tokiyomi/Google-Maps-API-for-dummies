If you don't have the googlemaps library installed, follow the steps below uwu

    1. Open "Anaconda Prompt" in your computer

## Jupyter Notebook
In the Jupyter Notebook --> **Googlemaps API for dummies** <-- attached in this repository, there is a step by step tutorial to get information about places using the googlemaps **Places API** in two different ways:
      
      1. By hand (if you are new using API, is recommended for you to learn how to do it manually)
      2. Using the googlemaps library (once mastered the first step, here comes the easy way)
